# Samples

Real world data captured by OpenHAP and associated simple data analysis examples.

* **Time**- Time the data was recorded in Unix time(Elapsed time inseconds since the unix epoch 00:00:00 UTC - 1 January 1970)

* **Mean temp**- Mean of all 24x32 pixel infared temperatures in OpenHAP's thermal imager field of view (FOV)

* **Max temp**- Maximum of all 24x32 pixel infared temperatures in OpenHAP's thermal imager field of view (FOV)

* **Min temp**- Minimum of all 24x32 pixel infared temperatures in OpenHAP's thermal imager field of view (FOV)

* **Temp variance**- Variance of all 24x32 pixel infared temperatures in OpenHAP's thermal imager field of view (FOV)

* **Temp variance**- square root of the Temperature variance above

* **Humidity**- Ambient humidity at the time of measurement

* **Temperature**- Ambient temperature at the time of measurement

* **PM1**- Amount of PM 1 measured within a one second interval based on the particulate matter sensor's active pump characteristics and volume of air swept.

* **PM2.5**- Amount of PM 2.5 measured within a one second interval based on the particulate matter sensor's active pump characteristics and volume of air swept.

* **PM10**- Amount of PM 10 measured within a one second interval based on the particulate matter sensor's active pump characteristics and volume of air swept.
