<h1 align="center">OpenHAP</h1>
<p align="center">An opensource research tool with remote measurement capability for non invasive, stationary monitoring of:
<ul align="center">
  <li>Household air pollution</li>
  <li>Stove temperatures and stove stacking</li>
  <li>Associated human behavioral patterns</li>
</ul></p> 
<p align="center">OpenHAP is designed as a modular software layer, utilising open datalogging file formats such as .csv for measurement data or numpy .npy files for timestamped thermal images, allowing easy data analysis in python, matlab and R and allowing you extend the software and build new hardware components to suit your measurement needs.</p>
