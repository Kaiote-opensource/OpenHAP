# OpenHAP

![OpenHAP image](assets/OpenHAP_labelled.jpg)

A low cost, opensource research tool with remote measurement capability for non invasive, stationary monitoring of:

* **Household air pollution.**

* **Stove temperatures and stove stacking.**

* **Associated human behavioral patterns.**

OpenHAP is designed as a modular software/firmware layer with ANSI C compatibility. It utilises open datalogging file formats such as:

* **.csv** for timestamped measurement data.

* [**.npy**](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html) numpy files for timestamped 2D thermal images for post analysis(2.8 KB size per thermal snapshot).

allowing easy data analysis in python, matlab and R while allowing you extend the software and build new hardware components to suit your measurement needs.
